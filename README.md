Let's create a programatic novel!

Or more specifically, a religious text.

But what does that mean?  I dont' really know!  So let's define what that means...in my amature way.


Religions can have a lot going on.  But we have to start small.  First draft.
--------------

Creation.  A good religious text should include where we came from.  How the world started, and how humans came to live on it.  What did those first humans do when they got here?

Human History.  What did humans do for all that time before then and now.

Rules. We want to know how to live.  What we can do, and not do.

Rewards.  If you follow the rules, you get a reward!

The End.  Many people want to know how the world will end, or what will happen.
